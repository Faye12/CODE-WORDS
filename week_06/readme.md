# Exploration and Experimentation - Week 06

## Ryoji Ikeda
This week I began to look into visual and sound art, especially the work of [*Ryoji Ikeda*](http://www.ryojiikeda.com/) and his [*datamatics*](http://www.ryojiikeda.com/project/datamatics/?fbclid=IwAR3fjztq06NIOVAcqhVfksC-cztDaakEeMaU3bNkZ6g3TesdKGrbt7JWp5E) project "that explores the potential to perceive the invisible multi-substance of data that permeates our world. It is a series of experiments in various forms - audiovisual concerts, installations, publications and CD releases - that seek to materialise pure data."

Im hoping to take inspiration from Ryoji's use of sound in his works and implement it into my Major Project and maybe even try to create some of my own sounds/music to experiment in Processing with.

## Processing Experimentation

Taking inspiration from the sense of atmosphere and immersion that Ryoji creates in his works I tried my hand at incorporating sound into my own work. Figuring out how to add the p5.js sound library was abit of a pain but once I got it working with Firefox (doesn't seem to work on Chrome) I think the outcome works really well using [*'Saline Drip'*](https://bblisss.bandcamp.com/track/saline-drip) an experimental ambient electronic song from Ben Bondy. Have a look at the [*outcome*](https://fergarundel.github.io/CODE-WORDS/week_06/SoundTest/) for youself, just make sure you're not using Chrome.
