# Mid-Semester Break - Week 07

##  Typography experimentation 
![](flashing_text.gif)

In the break I have started to focus more on typography and ways in which I can create an interesting and interactive design that moves beyond regular digital reading. Using the introduction from Jospeh Beuys' manifesto I have attempted to make a visually compelling outcome which could be further expanded upon in the future using different interactive methods. I know there must be a better way to go about this outcome but for now this example works to give a general idea of the feel of the digital space. To make this passage more readable I could use phrases instead of words, creating a more natural reading pattern.
