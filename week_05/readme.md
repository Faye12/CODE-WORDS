# Club Penguin and Foucault - Week 05
## Assignment 02 Submission
This week we started the class with sharing the rough cut for our Re-Reading videos, it was amazing to see the work everyone had put into their videos and all the interesting and werid outcomes people managed to create. I was pretty happy with our [*outcome*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxVLtIr6eNs) too, although in retrospect I would've rathered done the video in a virtual world which allows more creative freedom and control such as Minecraft or Second Life.
## Michel Foucault - Of Other Spaces
![](foucault.jpg)
Continuing on with the semester I searched the wonderfully curated [*online reader*](http://digbeyond.com/readme/phplist.php?course=Code-Words) for a reading that I will be using for my Major Project. I came across Michel Foucault's [*'Of Other Spaces'*](https://web.mit.edu/allanmc/www/foucault1.pdf), having a very limited knowledge of Foucault's work I was interested in what the essay was about. In the reading Foucault talks about places called Heterotopias, which wikipedia defines as certain cultural, institutional and discursive spaces that are somehow ‘other’: disturbing, intense, incompatible, contradictory or transforming. Heterotopias are worlds within worlds, mirroring and yet upsetting what is outside. 

Foucault provides the reader with examples such as cemeteries, bars, brothels, prisons, gardens, fairs and what Foucault describes as the heterotopia par excellence, the ship. However, I believe that the internet has now replaced the ship as the heterotopia par excellence, of course Foucault died before the internet became what it is today so there is no mention of it. I found this text extremely interesting and think that it has potential to be interpreted into a digital version very well.
